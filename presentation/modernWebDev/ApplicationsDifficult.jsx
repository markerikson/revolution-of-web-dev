                    <b>People assume that writing an APPLICATION for a browser is easy,</b>
                    which is why people get stuck maintaining monstrosities that are
                    disorganized, not composed and tens of thousands of lines of spaghetti.
                    <b> Writing an application in the browser deserves just as much respect as
                    one would give towards setting up the database & schema or creating a
                    service layer.</b>  That lack of respect for front end code is a big reason
                    as to why front end projects have [lousy] code.

                    Yes, you'll need (webpack|jspm|browserify) with (babel|typescript), 
                    and likely (postcss|less|scss) in place closer to the start than the 
                    end. Much like if you're writing code for a desktop application you'll 
                    likely need at least an IDE installed, and potentially several libraries 
                    close to the start.  â€¦ What does it take to get a Java application going? 
                    Maven, some build system, some other tooling, and understanding the 
                    component/class hierarchies? It's not any easier than working with any new tooling.
